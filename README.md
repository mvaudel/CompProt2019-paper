# Computational Proteomics Paper 

## Description 

This repository contains the manuscript in computational proteomics. Our aim here is to describe how the proteomics community is developing and using bioinformatics software. 

## Repo structure

- manuscript.md: is the document containing the main manuscript. 
- data: is the folder containing the `data` from citations, polls. 
- source: Source code in R, python to compute the statistics.

## Results of the analysis can be partically check in:

## Commenting and contributing 

We hope to write a manuscript by the computational proteomics community that discuss the challenges, opportunities and drawbacks in current Computational Proteomics by 2019. Feel free to open an issue if there is any point you would like to raise or discuss.

- Anyone from the community is encourage to discuss topics for the manuscript, including structure, titles, topics, etc. This can be done by opening an issue in [issues](https://github.com/ypriverol/compomics-paper/issues). 

- If you want to change a document including the manuscript, statistics, or figure; you can do it by creating a Pull request into the master branch. 

- Fell free to browse through existing/past issues and if one seems related, comment on it. If no existing issue seems appropriate, a new issue can be opened to discuss the suggestion. In particular, we would appreciate discussing more substantial changes (for example suggestion of new rules) in a dedicated issue before sending a pull request.

If you are new to Git, read [Github getting started](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

- If, based on your contribution, you would like to be added as a co-author, please open an issue and provide your name and affiliation and a short description of your contribution or a link to the relevant issue and pull request.

## Final words

Please the process of writing a paper in Github can be painful at the beginning but be patient and you will enjoy the complete process. Science must be always open!!!!
